For more recent NumPy versions (1.16 and later), the `matmul` and `dot` functions automatically take care of this (*If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by appending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the appended 1 is removed.* See the notes in the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)). For previous versions, you need to manually extend the dimensionality, so that `xi.shape: (2,1)`, and you can multiply the $2\\times2$ matrix with the $2\\times1$ point. After transformation you need to remove the added dimension, e.g., by indexing `x[:,0]`.\n",
